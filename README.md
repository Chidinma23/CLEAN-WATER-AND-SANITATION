# Introduction
Safe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene are crucial to human health and well-being. It is not only a prerequisite to health, but contributes also to our livelihoods helping to create resilient communities living in healthy environments.
Poor hygiene, inadequate quantities and quality of drinking water, and lack of sanitation facilities cause millions of the worldâ€™s poorest people to die from preventable diseases each year.

# Project Name: 
EFFECT OF CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION IN DISEASES CONTROL IN AFRICA: SDG GOAL 6: CLEAN WATER & SANITATION

# Project Overview
Access to water, sanitation and hygiene is a human right, yet billions are still faced with daily challenges accessing even the most basic of services.
Around 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is feacally contaminated while about 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation services, such as toilets or latrines. 
Water scarcity affects more than 40% of the global population and is projected to rise. More than 80% of wastewater resulting from human activities is discharged into rivers or sea without any treatment, leading to pollution. 

# Data Sourcing:
